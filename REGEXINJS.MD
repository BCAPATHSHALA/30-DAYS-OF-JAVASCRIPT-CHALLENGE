# Intro to Regex for Web Developers

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for finding patterns in strings. As a web developer, understanding regex can help you with tasks such as validating user input, extracting data from strings, and replacing text.

## What are Regular Expressions?

Regular expressions are a way to describe a search pattern using a string of characters. They can be used to find matches in a string, and can be created using a variety of methods, including forward slashes `//` or the `new RegExp()` constructor.

## 1.

- Regular expressions find parts of a string that match a pattern and then used in methods like `match`, `test`, or `replace`
- You can define the regex beforehand, or directly when calling the method

## 2.

- Match individual characters one at a time, or put multiple characters in square `brackets []` to capture any that match Capture a range of characters with a `hyphen -`

## 3.

- Add optional flags to the end of a regex to modify how the matcher works.

- In JavaScript, these flags are:

1. `i` = case insensitive
2. `m` = multi line matching
3. `g` = global match (find all, instead of find one)

## 4.

- Using a `caret ^` at the start means **"start of string"**
- Using a `dollar sign $` at the end means **"end of string"**
- Start putting groups of matches together to match longer strings

## 5.

- Use wildcards and special escaped characters to match larger classes of characters

1. `.` = any character except line break
2. `\d` = digit
3. `\D` = NOT a digit
4. `\s` = white space
5. `\S` = any NON white space
6. `\n` = new line

## 6.

- Match only certain counts of matched characters or groups with quantifiers

1.  `.*` = zero or more
2.  `?` = 0 or 1
3.  `{3}` = exactly 3 times
4.  `{2, 4}` = two, three, or four times
5.  `{2,}` = two or more times

</p>

## 7.

- Use `parens ()` to capture in a group.
- `match` will return the full match plus the groups, unless you use the `g` flag
- Use the `pipe operator |` inside of `parens ()` to specify what that group matches

## 8.

- To match special characters, escape them with a `backslash \`

- Special characters in JS regex are: `^` `$` `\` `.` `*` `+` `?` `( )` `[ ]` `{ }` `|`

- So to match an `asterisks`, you'd use: `\*` Instead of just `*`

## 9.

- To match anything BUT a certain character, use a `caret ^` inside of square brackets. This means `^` has two meanings, which can be confusing.

- It means both **"start of string"** when it is at the front of a regex, and **"not this character"** when used inside of square brackets.

## 10.

ðŸ’¡ Regexs can be used to find and match all sort of things, from urls to filenames

ðŸ’¡ HOWEVER! be careful if you try to use regexs for really complex tasks, such as parsing emails (which get really confusing, really fast), or HTML (which is not a regular language, and so can't be fully parsed by a regular expression)
